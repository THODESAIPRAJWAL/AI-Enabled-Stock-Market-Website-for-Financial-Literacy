1.	Abstract:

In order to deliver real-time stock market information and forecasts with an emphasis on users who lack financial literacy, this project intends to build a website that incorporates AI and ML approaches. The website provides interactive tools and a user-friendly interface to assist users in navigating the stock market with confidence. The website employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) for the analysis of news articles and other text data, Time Series Forecasting with LSTM model, and Computer Vision for the analysis of charts and financial time-series data[1]. The website also gives users with access to real-time stock prices, market trends, and investing techniques. The outcomes show that the website can address the issues of financial illiteracy and lack of access to pertinent information in the stock market in a comprehensive and user-friendly manner. The main findings of this study are that, even for users who lack financial literacy, combining AI and ML approaches may considerably increase their capacity to make educated judgements in the stock market.[2] 

2.	Introduction
2.1.	Context:
Even seasoned investors may find it challenging to manage the complicated and volatile stock market. Access to pertinent knowledge, experience, and information is necessary for making well- informed financial decisions. Nonetheless, it is a regular issue, especially for users who are financially illiterate, to lack access to important information and expertise. This frequently results in ill-informed and foolish investing choices that cost money.


Globally, the issue of financial illiteracy has persisted and has an impact on people, homes, and communities. Financial literacy is the capacity to make wise decisions about the use and management of money, according to the World Bank. A National Financial Educators Council (NFEC) poll indicates that about 57% of Americans lack basic financial literacy. This raises serious concerns since it shows how many people lack access to important knowledge and information.


In the context of the stock market, which is sometimes regarded as a major path for wealth generation, the lack of financial literacy is especially worrisome. Yet, having access to current information, data analysis, and forecasts is necessary for making wise investing choices on the stock market. Users who lack financial literacy may become confused and make illogical decisions as a result of this information's overwhelming nature. However, many of the stock market research programmes now available are made for seasoned traders and investors, making them inappropriate for individuals with little or no financial literacy[3].


A user-friendly platform that blends AI and ML approaches is required to solve this issue and deliver real-time insights and forecasts that can enable consumers to make wise investment decisions. Such a platform can give consumers thorough and trustworthy information so they may make educated financial decisions by merging cutting-edge techniques like NLP, Time Series Forecasting utilising LSTM model, and Computer Vision. The goal of this project is to combat financial illiteracy by creating a user-friendly platform that combines AI and ML approaches to deliver real-time stock market data and forecasts. By enabling users who lack financial literacy to make educated investing decisions, the platform can help them improve their financial well-being.


2.2	Existing literature and Limitations:


The application of AI and ML algorithms for stock market analysis has been examined in several research articles. In order to anticipate stock prices and make trading choices, Hwang and Kim (2020) suggested a deep learning-based stock trading model that makes use of 1D convolutional neural networks and adversarial training. Time series analysis models ARIMA and LSTM were utilised by Maru and Pattanaik (2019) to forecast stock market values. Natural language processing and categorization algorithms were utilised by Jain and Dhaka (2020) to find pertinent news items and forecast stock market movements.[4] 
Using Twitter data, Javed and Ashraf (2019)[5] predicted stock prices using sentiment analysis and recurrent neural networks. The limitations of AI and ML approaches for stock market analysis need to be addressed notwithstanding their potential. In a dynamic environment where patterns are changing quickly, many existing models that are based on past data may not be able to forecast future trends with any degree of accuracy. Second, bias or noise may affect the accuracy of models that use data from news articles or social media. Moreover, many current models may be too complicated or challenging for the typical investor to understand, which restricts their applicability.. To determine sentiment and get insights on how actual events and announcements may affect the stock market, for instance, NLP has been used to scan news stories and other text data. Similar to this, financial data has been utilised in time series forecasting using RNN models to predict future values.[6]


Despite the fact that earlier study looked at the potential of AI and ML approaches for stock market analysis, there are still a number of issues that need to be resolved. First of all, the majority of the current systems are made for seasoned traders and investors and are thus inappropriate for consumers who lack financial literacy. Second, the algorithms employed by these platforms might be intricate and challenging for the typical user to comprehend, which causes confusion and a lack of confidence in the outcomes. Finally, the quality and quantity of data utilised for analysis might affect how accurate and reliable these algorithms are. By creating a user-friendly platform that incorporates AI and ML techniques for stock market analysis, this project seeks to overcome these limitations. With a user-friendly interface and interactive features, the platform will be created with the financially uneducated user in mind, enabling them to confidently explore the stock market. The platform will deliver thorough and trustworthy information that may help users make educated financial decisions thanks to the usage of cutting-edge techniques including NLP, Time Series Forecasting utilising LSTM models, and Computer Vision. By doing this, the platform may significantly aid in solving the issue of financial illiteracy and limited access to pertinent stock market information.


2.3	Objective of this research:

3.	Literature Review: Revision Plan:
 Zhang, X., Wang, C., & Li, Y. (2019).To forecast stock market movements, recent research on the topic has been thoroughly reviewed in this study. The authors examine several procedures, such as deep learning techniques, time series forecasting, and regression analysis. They come to the conclusion that LSTM networks, in particular, provide the best accurate stock price predictions when using deep learning techniques[15][16]. Wang, Y., Li, Y., & Zhou, X. (2018).
In this work, natural language processing (NLP) methods are investigated for the analysis and forecasting of stock values in financial news items.[16] The decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks utilised in machine learning are all reviewed by the writers. They discover that LSTM networks deliver the best outcomes for stock price forecasting using financial news analysis[17].According to Jakob Aungiers' "Predicting Stock Prices with Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks," The use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks for stock price prediction is discussed in this research. The author offers an LSTM model that can identify trends in previous stock price data and forecast outcomes depending on the state of the market. The experiment findings in the study demonstrate the viability of the suggested strategy.

Zheng, X., Zhao, J., & Zhang, X. (2019):This study suggests using deep learning to analyse sentiment in financial news stories. Long short-term memory (LSTM) network and convolutional neural network are used by the authors to represent the temporal relationships in the data and to extract features from news articles, respectively. The study's experimental findings demonstrate the viability of the suggested method for forecasting stock price changes using sentiment analysis.Zhengyao Jiang et al., "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Portfolio Management"[18]: In this study, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) strategy for portfolio management is proposed. The authors develop a portfolio allocation approach that optimises returns while minimising risk using a DRL agent. The report presents experimental findings that demonstrate the efficacy of the suggested strategy and highlight its potential to enhance portfolio management in practical settings.


Thomas W. H. Willems et al., "Machine Learning for Stock Selection: A Review," In this work, machine learning strategies for stock selection are reviewed. Factor models, decision trees, and neural networks are only a few of the methods covered by the writers. The study summarises the benefits and drawbacks of each strategy and emphasises the need of taking into account model interpretability, data quality, and ethical issues in machine learning applications in finance.Guoqiang Jiang et al., "A Study on Time Series Forecasting Using Deep Learning": This paper offers an overview of deep learning-based time series forecasting. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and hybrid models are only a few of the methods covered by the writers. In addition to highlighting the need of taking data quality, model interpretability, and ethical issues into account in time series forecasting applications, the study presents an overview of the benefits and drawbacks of each strategy.


In the financial sector, combining machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches has gained popularity. This study analyses various recent research that investigate the application of these methods for in-the-moment stock market insights and forecasts, with an emphasis on raising users' financial literacy. The use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to evaluate news stories and other text data to discern sentiment and acquire understanding of how actual events and announcements may effect the stock market is a crucial field of research. For instance, Zhang et al. (2019) created a sentiment analysis model that use deep learning
 
algorithms to categorise news stories into favourable, unfavourable, or neutral categories, which may be used to forecast future stock prices[19]. Similar to this, Li et al. (2021) showed how financial indicators may increase the accuracy of stock price forecast by extracting them from news articles and social media. Time series forecasting utilising recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or long short-term memory (LSTM) models to predict future values based on financial data is another field of research[20]. In order to anticipate stock prices, Wang et al. (2020) suggested a hybrid deep learning model that blends LSTM with technical indicators. They demonstrated how their model performed better than conventional time series forecasting techniques. In order to accurately anticipate stock prices Xie, J., Xie, R., & Gao, X. (2019). (2021) also employed LSTM models, highlighting the significance of combining both technical and fundamental variables in the model. Another method that has been used to examine graphs and financial
time-series data in order to find patterns and make forecasts is computer vision. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a cutting-edge technique that Liao et al. (2021) can be used to examine candlestick patterns and make trading judgements[21]. They showed that their model performed better than conventional technical analysis techniques.[22]

Studies have looked into using these methods to give people access to a multitude of financial data, such as current stock prices, market trends, and investing tactics. A platform that combines AI and cloud computing, for instance, was built by Liu et al. (2019) to offer tailored investment recommendations based on user preferences and risk tolerance. Overall, these research show the potential of AI and ML approaches to deliver real-time stock market insights and forecasts, as well as to raise user financial literacy[23]. Nevertheless, further study is required to solve issues like data accessibility and model interpretability and to create user-friendly interfaces that can confidently guide even new investors through the stock market.[24]

Using the Yahoo Finance API and a machine learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, we use python code to creates a graph of the stock values of a specified business. The following actions are taken by the algorithm after receiving the business name as an input: Using the yfinance library, retrieve past stock price data from Yahoo Finance. Preprocess the data by removing extra columns, scale it using MinMaxScaler, and split it into training and testing groups. The training set is used to train the LSTM model, and the testing set is used to evaluate forecasts. Use the matplotlib plotting library to compare the stock prices of the real and forecasted indices. Use the mpld3 tool to convert the graph to HTML, then save it as a file.

                                           Fig 6:- Amazon Stock Prediction Using CV.
Using the requests library, the method cv_graphs(company) retrieves past intraday stock data for a particular business from the Alpha Vantage API. The CSV data is then received using the csv tool and stored in a Pandas DataFrame. Preprocessing the DataFrame entails changing the time column to a Pandas datetime format, sorting the DataFrame by the time column, and transforming the open, high, low, and close columns to numeric data types. Using a boolean mask, the function filters the data to include only the stock market's working hours (between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.), extracts unique dates from the DataFrame's time column, loops over the unique dates, and generates a new Candlestick chart for each date using the plotly.graph_objs module. It then uses the rolling() method to compute the moving average of the closing price of the selected rows, creates a Scatter plot of the trend line with the x values from the data column and the y values from the moving average, and combines the candlestick chart and the trend line Scatter plot in a new Figure object using the go.Figure() method.

Finally, it uses the pio.write_html() method to write the HTML file of each Figure to the directory named after the business and numbered sequentially from 0 to the number of distinct dates. This function's auto_open parameter is set to False, so the generated HTML files are not viewed in the online browser.
